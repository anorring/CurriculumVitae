# 1. General information

I am currently a doctoral student in economics at the University of Helsinki. Ten years from now I will be a PhD in economics specialized in macroeconomics with solid understanding of how economies work gained from working with a central bank or an international organization.

I am interested in anything that is hard to understand. I firmly believe there is nothing more exciting than learning something new, be it in the field of economics, programming, dancing ballet or renovating. I like to learn new things by reading, listening and trying out: I am never caught without a book (or two) in my bag, I try to keep my language skills up by listening to i.e. a french science podcast while walking to work and I never say no, when something interesting comes my way.

# 2. What I do now: Doctoral studies

**9/2016 - 5/2020**  
**Doctor of Social Sciences in Economics**  
University of Helsinki, Faculty of Social Sciences  

In my thesis I study monetary policy and macroprudential policy in the presence of a global financial cycle. My first paper considers the effects of implementation of macroprudential policies on cross-border banking asset holdings.  

In my course work I have tried to emphasize maintaining, updating and improving my methodological know-how. I have taken courses on e.g. open data science (R, open data sources, Git). This spring I'm updating my Python skills with a focus on applied data science. This summer I'm taking courses on Bayesian times series methods, different classes of VARs and Bayesian methods for DSGE models at the Barcelona GSE Macroeconometrics Summer School.  

I am a doctoral student representative in the steering committee of the Doctoral Programme in Economics.

## 2.3 Research proposal for a doctoral thesis

### Constrained by the global financial cycle?  Monetary policy and macroprudential policy in the presence of large capital flows  

### 2.3.1 Introduction  

In international macroeconomics, the Mundell-Fleming trilemma has been a central feature since the seminal works of Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962). The policy trilemma states that a country can conduct independent monetary policy only if it either allows exchange rate to float or restricts capital mobility. As of late, the policy trilemma has however been questioned by literature. Several studies have suggested that the trilemma is in fact a dilemma: irrespective of the exchange rate regime, monetary policy can not be fully independent if capital flows are completely free. Rey finds evidence that global factors largely drive the capital flows into and out of emerging markets (Rey 2015) and also advanced economies (Rey 2016). This phenomenon, the “Global Financial Cycle” is on its part largely driven by the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve of the US (Rey 2015, 2016). Also Davis and Presno (2017) find evidence of US monetary policy affecting the nominal interest rates of countries with floating currencies and open capital accounts. Rey argues that this is due to the importance of dollar for international financial markets and the dependence of global banks on dollar-denominated funding. Through this “international credit channel” the monetary conditions of US are transmitted abroad as international banks raise dollar funds and then transmit this dollar liquidity globally. McCauley et al. (2015) also point out that as the bulk of dollar debt is held abroad, it serves to transmit the US monetary policy immediately around the globe.  

To explain the dilemma, the studies put forward an explanation that hinges on price and credit rigidities. The independence of monetary policy is restricted, because even a fully flexible exchange rate is unable to balance the effect of large and fast-moving capital flows in the presence of rigidities. Monetary policy aimed at stabilizing prices is no longer optimal, and instead policy makers have to take into account the monetary policy of the central economy and try to influence capital flows with the domestic policy rate. This may lead to monetary policy ill suited for the domestic economy. The imported monetary conditions can be too tight or too lax and may lead to financial instability even in countries with floating exchange rate.  

To restore the independence of monetary policy, the academic literature suggest controlling the capital account by imposing a tax on certain capital flows. Capital controls are however usually considered more a crisis management tool than a macroprudential instrument aimed at preventing financial instability, at least in the advanced economies. The task of securing independent monetary policy thus falls on more conventional macroprudential policies, which have been shown to be able to replicate the effects of capital controls (see e.g. Korinek and Sandri, 2014). Rey (2015) emphasizes countercyclical policies aimed at credit and leverage growth (such as the countercyclical capital buffers of Basel III), and structural policies aimed at leverage of all financial institutions. This reasoning lends further importance for the developing and implementing of macroprudential tools that has been taken up with rigour after the global financial crisis.   

Within a monetary union, the monetary and macroprudential policy mix takes a special twist, as pointed out by Galati and Moessner (2013): when monetary policy is not controlled on the national level, national macroprudential policies can be used to affect domestic conditions, e.g. the growth of credit. Indeed, this is one of the raisons d’être for national macroprudential policies in a monetary union with shared monetary policy, as shown by Clancy and Merola (2017). There is, however, a catch, when this strand of literature is considered parallel to a growing literature on the cross-border leakage of macroprudential policies and regulatory arbitrage. There is growing evidence that the effects of macroprudential instruments occasionally spill over borders through international bank lending (see e.g. a meta study of Buch and Goldberg and the research cited therein, 2016) and that this may reduce the effectiveness of national macroprudential policies (e.g. Reinhardt and Sowerbutts, 2015).  

In the presence of free capital flows and extensive cross-border activities of large international banks, the effects of macroprudential policies are not confined in the country that implements them. Cross-border spillovers of macroprudential policy may arise e.g. when banks exploit differences in the standards of national regulation by placing their activities in countries with the least imposing regulatory requirements. This regulatory arbitrage can to some extent be mitigated by mutual recognition, often referred to as reciprocity, of macroprudential measures by the national authorities of different countries. Even though the leakages have so far been found to be rather small, they may increase as national macroprudential policies become more widespread (Buch and Goldberg, 2016). So far, there has been little thorough consideration of how the optimal mix of monetary and macroprudential policies changes, when the effectiveness of macroprudential policy is also compromised by cross-border capital flows. This is the gap in knowledge my doctoral thesis aims to fill.  


### 2.3.2 Research problem

In my dissertation I study macroprudential policy in an open economy subject to free capital flows and the effect those flows have on the optimal policy set-up. Does the global financial cycle, manifested through free capital flows and regulatory arbitrage, tie the hands of macroprudential policy makers in a manner similar to the way the autonomy of monetary policy makers may be compromised? Specifically, I aim to find out what the leakages of macroprudential policy mean for the interplay of monetary policy and macroprudential policy. It is often postulated, that in an optimal policy mix, one of the most important tasks for macroprudential policy is to restore the independence of monetary policy. But what if the effectiveness of macroprudential policy itself is reduced by cross-border leakages? What would the optimal policy mix be in this case?  

The thesis will include a survey, an empirical paper, a theoretical paper and a third paper on an extension to the model build in the theoretical paper. The purpose of the survey is to map the current state of understanding on macroprudential policy in an open economy with free capital mobility. The aim of the empirical paper is to investigate the interdependence of macroprudential policies and capital flows for several developed economies. The theoretical paper will build a model of optimal macroprudential policy in the presence of the global financial cycle. The third paper will extend the model by considering an environment of high leverage and low interest rates.  


### 2.3.3 Research methods and data  

The empirical paper on the interdependence of macroprudential policies and capital flows will build on the gravity model of financial asset trade, first proposed by Portes and Rey (2005). The paper will concentrate on the effects of countercyclical capital regulation. By considering only one macroprudential tool the paper will be able to consider also the changes in the intensity of regulation, and not simply a dichotomous index of macroprudential actions. Data on macroprudential measures is obtained from the IMF survey on Global Macroprudential Policy Instruments (GMPI) and on bilateral cross-border banking flows from the BIS International Banking Statistics. Data on the control variables is obtained from different sources such as the World Bank Economic Indicators and a dataset compiled by CEPII which contains the variables most often used in estimating gravity models.  

The theoretical paper will build a DSGE model with the model of Clancy and Merola (2017), assessing the effectiveness of countercyclical capital regulation in small open economies, as a starting point. The paper will develop this model further by considering also the effect of capital flows on macroprudential regulation. The model will be calibrated using data for a small open advanced economy with a flexible exchange rate to validate the model’s ability to reproduce the relevant stylized facts.  



## 2.4 First paper: Macroprudential tools, crossborder banking asset holdings and the gravity model

### 2.4.1 Motivation for the paper:

Macroprudential policy is often looked upon as a means to return the independence of monetary policy, which can be reduced by various different reasons. However, there are still large gaps in knowledge on the effectiveness of macroprudential policies, even though the field is expanding rapidly. To gain fuller understanding on the effectiveness of macroprudential policies, one should not confine considerations to the ability of prudential tools to deliver the desired outcomes inside the country implementing the policies. After all, macroprudential policy cannot be implemented in a hermetic bubble. Instead, national macroprudential policy cannot be insulated from the global financial conditions and the some leakages and spillovers from the implemented policies are unavoidable.  

There is growing evidence that the effects of macroprudential instruments occasionally spill over borders through international bank lending (see e.g. a meta study of Buch and Goldberg and the research cited therein, 2016, Agénor et al., 2017) and that this may reduce the effectiveness of national macroprudential policies (e.g. Reinhardt and Sowerbutts, 2015). In the presence of large, free and fast-moving capital flows and extensive cross-border activities of large international banks, the effects of macroprudential policies are not confined in the country that implements them. Cross-border spillovers of macroprudential policy may arise e.g. when banks exploit differences in the standards of national regulation by placing their activities in countries with the least imposing regulatory requirements. This regulatory arbitrage can to some extent be mitigated by mutual recognition, often referred to as reciprocity, of macroprudential measures by the national authorities of different countries. Even though the leakages have so far been found to be rather small, they may increase as national macroprudential policies become more widespread (Buch and Goldberg, 2016). 

### 2.4.2 Reasearch questions and hypotheses

> Can the gravity model tell us something about the crossborder spillovers of macroprudential tools? 

> What is the effect of certain often used macroprudential tools on bilateral, cross-border banking asset holdings?

Master's thesis topic: Cross-border investments, gravity equations and the double-hurdle model. Graded eximia cum laude approbatur (6/7).  
Bachelor's thesis topic: Macroeconomic effects of venture capitalism. Graded 5/5.  

I graduated as a master of social sciences from the University of Helsinki in January 2015 with economics as my major subject. During my studies I took a special interest in macroeconomics and tried to emphasize this in the courses I selected. I graduated as a bachelor of social sciences in May 2012. I have minored in statistics (GPA 4.0) and have mathematics as a second major (GPA 4.0).  

In my master’s thesis I proposed a previously untapped econometric method, the double-hurdle model, for estimating the determinants of cross-border investments. My goal was to write a thesis with actual scientific relevance and I was proud to achieve this. My thesis was graded Eximia cum laude approbatur, or 6/7.  

In my bachelor's thesis I studied the possible macroeconomic effects of venture capitalism. I was able to publish an article based on my thesis at the Bank of Finland. My thesis was graded 5/5.  

**8/2006 - **  
**Master of Science in Mathematics**  
University of Helsinki, Faculty of Science.   
Major subject mathematics, minor subject economics and statistics. Overall GPA 4/5.  

I started as a mathematics student in the University of Helsinki, but my studies centered on economics at a fairly early stage. Studying mathematics has improved my analytic skills, which I have noticed to be endlessly valuable in working life.  

## 3.2 Other education

**5/2006**  
**It&auml;keskus Upper Secondary School, language program.**  
Matriculation examination in 9 subjects with an overall degree of eximia cum laude approbatur.

# 4. Professional experience

## 4.1 Bank of Finland

**1/2018 - 3/2018**  
**Economist**  
**Bank of Finland, Financial Stability and Statistics, Division of Macroprudential Policy**  
I worked with issues related to macroprudential policy, financial stability and prudential regulation. My work consisted of writing analysis for internal reports and Bank of Finland publications, giving presentations, preparing policy briefs and comments for various high-level meetings and participating in seminars and conferences. I also conducted my own research on the effects of macroprudential instruments on bilateral cross-border bank asset holdings, related to my PhD-thesis. 


**5/2017 - 9/2017**  
**Economist**  
**Bank of Finland, Financial Stability and Statistics, Division of Macroprudential Policy**  
My work mainly consisted of conducting my own research on monetary and macroprudential policy in the presence of a global financial cycle. I also wrote analysis on e.g. the financial stability spillovers from China, prepared briefs for various high-level meeting and participated in seminars and conferences. Two of my analysis were published in the Bank of Finland blog (in Finnish). I was also asked to write a piece on China and financial stability spillovers in Kauppalehti, a Finnish business newspaper. An enjoyable side project was participating in a summer innovation competition, which I won with my proposal for developing the way the Bank of Finland and the Financial Supervisory Authority engage with the younger generations.  

**10/2014 - 2/2016**  
**Economist, China**  
**Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition (BOFIT)**  
I was part of a team of three economists that follows and analyzes the Chinese economy at the Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition or BOFIT. My responsibilities included e.g. writing weekly about the most important economic events in China to the BOFIT Weekly, which contains timely analysis and news about the Russian and Chinese economy. Besides the BOFIT Weekly, I wrote ad-hoc analysis for internal use and for publications such us our BOFIT Policy Brief -series and Bank of Finland blog. Communicating our view on the Chinese economy to the media and other interest groups as well as networking with other China experts was also an important part of the job, as was taking part in various seminars, conferences and workshops. My work was mainly policy work, but as academic work is also an integral part of BOFIT, I did eg. have the opportunity of being a discussant at Asian Economic Panel 2015 at the Lund University in Sweden. My comments were published in [MIT Press Journal Asian Economic Papers (Summer 2016, Vol. 15, No. 2 , Pages 134-135)](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/ASEP_a_00433).  

In addition to my responsibilities at BOFIT, I organized two types of seminars. The first one is open to the whole personnel and held on average twice a month. In this series experts at Bank of Finland and Financial Supervision Authority give presentations on interesting and topical themes. The other is a summer seminar open for summer trainees and organized once a week during the summer months.  

I tried to keep my ability to give a presentation about something else than economics alive by occasionally presenting the art collection of the Bank of Finland for different kinds of visitors. When talking about e.g. the Chinese economy, you can up to a degree anticipate the questions asked. With the guided art tours, you have no idea what the visitors may come up with.  

**1/2014 - 10/2014**  
**Economist intern**  
**Bank of Finland, Financial Stability and Statistics, Division of Statistical analysis**  
My responsibilities included e.g. developing a new compiling process for insurance company and pension fund statistics, and publishing and presenting investment fund statistics. I also mapped and drafted illustrations of all the different work processes of the statistics compiled and published by the statistics department of the Bank of Finland, as this had not been done before.  

During summer 2014 I thought up and organized a seminar for summer trainees, in which economists and other experts of the Bank of Finland gave presentations on different topics related to their field of work. The seminar provided opportunities of discussion on a multitude of subjects and made the functions of the central bank more familiar for the trainees. The seminar was received well by trainees and presenters alike and will in the coming years be included in the schedule of summer trainees.

**4/2011 - 12/2013**  
**Economist intern**  
**Bank of Finland, Financial Stability and Statistics, Division of Balance of Payments**  
The most extensive project I did was a methodological project aimed at improving the quality of balance of payments statistics by reducing the balancing item of the statistical framework. On the account of this work I wrote an article "Maksutaseen tunnistamattomat ja virheelliset erät" (see publications, in Finnish with an abstract in English), which was published in the Bank of Finland BoF Online -series.  

My other responsibilities included e.g. compiling and publishing the balance of payments statistics and streamlining the process of the monthly online publication. I also had the opportunity to write an article based on my bachelor's thesis and published in the Financial Market Report of Bank of Finland. 

## 4.2 Other

**10/1998 - 3/2011**  
**Financial administrative assistant, assistant**  
**Moskito Group Oy, previously Varesvuo Partners Oy**  
I gained experience in financial administration at Moskito Group Oy, which is the parent company of a concern consisting of media, advertising and TV-production companies. In Moskito Group I worked for several years as an accounting and office assistant after school and during school holidays.  

I started in the company as a young girl (prior to getting paid for real since I was twelve, I was paid in cute stationary), helping out in the office during school holidays and gaining more responsibility as my experience increased. For the last two years there I was responsible for the management of purchase invoices for almost the entire concern.  

The most valuable experience from Moskito was the opportunity to gain work experience at a very young age and the ability to organize my work very independently.

## 5.4 Media appearances


# 6. Hobbies

##6.1 Reading:
I have been devouring books since I was a baby (quite literally, as my mother maintains). The family lore tells that I would not fall asleep without at least four books in my bed and that I learned to read when I was four because my parents simply could not read to me as much as I wanted. To this day, I never leave home without a book. Or two.

When I started to school, my grandfather gave me a notebook where I could write down the books I read. I’ve managed to keep this habit up, meaning that I have data on my reading for most of my life:


## 6.2 Investing:
In 8th grade, I unexpectedly won a competition my school organized on economics. As the first price I received a small share in a mutual fund. That share ended up being one my worst investments so far: out of pure nostalgia I kept it for 15 years and at last sold for a 8 % profit. I made 3,45€. Luckily, I’ve made also better investments after that.

I like the thrill of catching a bargain and watching it’s value grow. Like the wreckage of an appartment on the far edge of Punavuori I was able to buy when I was 18 years old, which I completely renovated myself using something like 2000 euros and lived in for the years of seriously great afterparties. Since then, the most exclusive neighbourhood in Helsinki has been built right next to my old shady block, I've had only trustworthy tenants and getting a valuation for the place gives me a ridiculous amount of joy.  

It doesn’t have to be only stocks and funds and apartments though. Some of my best investments (in terms of hypothetical profit, to be honest these are things I would not part with) have been art works or furniture. One of my favorites: a very big floor lamp, on its way to the dumpster, which I carried home to my tiny first apparment and which turned out to be a super rare and passionately collected industrial lamp designed by the great Finnish designer Yrjö Kukkapuro.

## 6.3 Ballet:
I’ve danced classical ballet since I was a kid. These days I dance on average six hours a week. Pirouettes are my specialty: I can’t lift my leg past my head or jump very high, but I can spin. Unfortunately, I have no data to back my claim though.
